   2. accuracy
      
      The highest accuracy the eurosat dataset went to was also about 80%. Both datasets had
      roughly the same amount of error as well.
 
     
2. Image augmentation
   
    a. Did your model performance improve?
   
    b. How many epochs were you able to run and how much time did it take?
   
      I was able to run 10 epochs, which only took about 2 minutes - the length of one epoch before augmentation.
