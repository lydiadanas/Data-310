1. Predicting wealth vs all other classes as binary target

First model:
![img_48.png](img_48.png)
Age buckets = 9, 18, 72

Second model:
age buckets = 25, 50, 75
   found by np.percentile on the dataset's age column
size buckets = 5, 6, 9
   found by same way as above

    - Best model:
    - Worst model:
    
2. Confusion matrix

    - Analyze and discuss two sets of results
    
3. Predicting wealth vs all other classes as categorical

    - Analyze and discuss results with confusion matrix as reference
    - Modify feature columns in attempt to improve accuracy with all 5 categorical wealth classes as target. Analyze and discuss progress and results.
