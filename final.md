Abstract

The problem I am trying to solve with my project is
distrust of public health information. I will be investigating this through the lens of 
Covid-19 cases per county and vaccine hesitancy data per county from the CDC. With those as my target variables, 
I will then use Department of Education literacy data as my features. I believe while online misinformation has contributed
to vaccine hesitancy, it is also highly possible that a lack of education would lead to believing in misinformation more easily, and 
a general distrust of public health. I think if this is the case, it should also correlate to Covid-19 cases.
