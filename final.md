Abstract

The problem I am trying to solve with my project is
distrust of public health information. I will be investigating this through the lens of 
vaccine hesitancy data per county from the CDC. With that as my target variable, 
I will then use Department of Education PIAAC data and 2019 population estimates as my features. I believe while online misinformation has contributed
to vaccine hesitancy, it is also highly possible that a lack of education would lead to believing in misinformation more easily, and 
a general distrust of public health. I think if this is the case, I should be able to train a model that accurately predicts
the CVAC level of vaccine hesitancy based on education data.
