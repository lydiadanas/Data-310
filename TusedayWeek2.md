1. Describe the dataset

    - Type of variable (target): 
    - How many features are being used:
    - How many observations are in the training dataset:
    - How many are used in the validation set:
    

2. Performance

    - How did each of the models perform?
    - Which of the four performed the best?
    - Which ones performed the worst?
    - Why did some perform better?
    

3. Overfit

    - What is an overfit model?
    - Why is it important to address it?
    - What are four ways we have addressed it so far?
    

4. Load and preprocess images

    - What are you functionally accomplishing as you apply the filter to your original array?
    - Why is the application of a convolving filter to an image useful for computer vision?

   - In effect what have you accomplished by applying this filter?
   - Does there seem to be a logic (i.e. maximizing, averaging or minimizing values?) associated with the pooling filter provided in the example exercise (convolutions & pooling)?
   - Did the resulting image increase in size or decrease?
   - Why would this method be useful?
   

5. Matrix:
