The first model I tried was with weights, age, unit, and size as numerical, gender and education as categorical (but numbers), and location, potable, toilet, electric, car, and cook as categorical. 
It was very accurate (0.958) for a wealth of 5, but became progressively less accurate (0.700 at the lowest) the lower the wealth was.
In the plot below, it is green.
